### (Probabilistic Inference Mouse data)

This repository contains code used to analyze neural recordings of mice while they learned an orientation-discrimination task.

Note that the `data` folder is deliberately empty, and `.mat` files are ignored. Only analysis code is kept here, not data nor results (and so the organization of some of the code may seem strange, given that it is designed to analyze a particularly formatted structure array of data)
